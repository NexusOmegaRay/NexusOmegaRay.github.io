    <h1>Yo-yos</h1>
    <p>While I wouldn’t say that yo-yoing is my favorite hobby, it is definitely something that I enjoy. I first got into yo-yoing when I was in elementary school. My school had someone come and put on a show, and we could order a yo-yo from them the next day. I ended up getting one, and I even gave a presentation on it in the 3rd grade. I lost interest in it eventually, but my interest was reignited when a game called Terraria received its 1.3 update. In this update, the game added a handful of yo-yos you could acquire as weapons. I really enjoyed using them and got back into yo-yoing as a result. Eventually, when my friends and I beat the final boss, it dropped a yo-yo named the <strong>Terrarian</strong>. This yo-yo had a little icon next to the name symbolizing it was a yo-yo from a brand the main developer of the game likes. He added a few of their yo-yos into the game and all of them had this symbol. But the <strong>Terrarian</strong> wasn’t a real yo-yo, just a final boss drop in a video game. That is, until a few months later, when the company, One Drop, released a real version of that yo-yo. I have one, and it is without a doubt my favorite of my modest collection.<br> You can see the webpage for the yo-yo here:</p>

    <p>And here is a photo of the model I have. It's colors are based off the Snow Biome. Naturally, my paint splatter pattern is different.</p>
